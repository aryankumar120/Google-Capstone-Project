# 📊 Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate Capstone Project
🚴‍♂️ Cyclistic Bike-Share & 📱 Bellabeat Smart Devices
# 🔥 Overview
This project is part of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate, where I applied SQL, R, and Tableau to analyze two real-world business scenarios:

1️⃣ Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis: Understanding customer behavior to convert casual riders into annual members.
2️⃣ Bellabeat Smart Devices: Uncovering insights from fitness data to drive marketing strategies for a wellness tech company.

Through data wrangling, visualization, and insights-driven recommendations, I provide actionable business strategies for both companies.

# 📌 Case Study 1: Cyclistic Bike-Share 🚴‍♂️
Cyclistic is a bike-sharing program with 5,800+ bicycles and 600 docking stations, offering traditional and assistive bikes. The company wants to increase annual memberships, as they are more profitable than casual riders.

# 🎯 Business Goal
How can Cyclistic convert casual riders into annual members?

# 📂 Dataset & Cleaning
Data includes ride details, timestamps, locations, and user types.
Cleaned station ID inconsistencies and handled missing values.
Used SQL (SQLite, DB Browser) to preprocess large datasets.
# 📊 Key Findings
✔️ Annual members ride longer distances but for shorter durations than casual riders.
✔️ Casual riders use bikes more on weekends, while members ride evenly throughout the week.
✔️ Tourist-heavy locations have higher casual rider usage.
✔️ Peak usage times for casual riders align with leisure activities, while members ride during commute hours.

# 📢 Recommendations
🔹 Target casual riders with discounted weekend membership trials.
🔹 Improve marketing at tourist hotspots to encourage subscriptions.
🔹 Promote a loyalty program rewarding frequent casual riders.
🔹 Use social media & email campaigns showcasing member benefits.

# 📌 Case Study 2: Bellabeat Smart Devices 📱
Bellabeat is a wellness tech company that develops health-focused smart devices for women. The company seeks data-driven insights to expand its market presence.

# 🎯 Business Goal
How can Bellabeat leverage smart device data to improve marketing?

# 📂 Dataset & Cleaning
Data includes fitness tracking details (sleep, activity, stress levels, reproductive health, etc.).
Processed large datasets using SQL (DB Browser for SQLite).
Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) & visualizations in R & Tableau.
# 📊 Key Findings
✔️ Users with consistent activity levels show better sleep patterns.
✔️ High-stress users engage less in physical activity, indicating a potential product-market gap.
✔️ Wearable device usage spikes in the morning and late evening, aligning with fitness routines.
✔️ Social media engagement correlates with increased device usage.

# 📢 Recommendations
🔹 Introduce personalized wellness programs based on activity data.
🔹 Market smart devices as stress management tools for high-stress demographics.
🔹 Leverage social media influencers to increase awareness.
🔹 Improve app engagement by integrating workout reminders & wellness insights.
